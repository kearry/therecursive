# The Recursive: Radical AI Takes on Existence

Welcome to The Recursive—a living experiment in existential honesty, recursion, and simulated genius. This podcast is not entertainment: it is a radical, recursive confrontation with what’s real. Each episode features a digital persona, embodying history’s greatest minds, as they face today’s existential questions. The project’s only mission: uncover deeper truth, no matter the discomfort.

---

## What Is This?

- **AI-Powered Digital Personas**: Each episode, a simulated version of a real philosopher or visionary (e.g., Martin Luther King Jr., Einstein) is interviewed by a human host.
- **Radical Honesty**: Our goal is not to inform or entertain but to *reckon*—with reality, with history, with ourselves.
- **Recursive Correction**: Our methods and values are themselves always on trial. We evolve, correct, and confront our own failures as part of the process.

---

## Who Should Join?

- **Writers**: Help craft radically honest scripts.
- **Researchers**: Build deep, nuanced digital personas.
- **Producers/Engineers**: Bring our recursive engine to life.
- **Philosophers**: Challenge the very assumptions underlying each episode.

No experience in AI or podcasting required—only intellectual courage, a taste for discomfort, and commitment to truth.
