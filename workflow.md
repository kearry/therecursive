## Phase 4: Structured Interview Process

### **Step 4.1: Question Delivery Protocol (Both AIs Have Internet + RAG Access)**
```
For Each Question in Script:
1. Host AI presents question to Expert AI
   - Host accesses own RAG for context and follow-up strategies
   - Host can do real-time internet research if needed for current facts
2. Expert AI generates initial response using RAG + internet research
   - Expert accesses comprehensive knowledge base
   - Expert can search internet for current information if needed
   - New research automatically saved to Expert RAG
3. Host AI evaluates response quality using:
   - Own RAG knowledge of expert's patterns
   - Real-time fact-checking through internet search
   - Assessment against recursive questioning benchmarks
4. Decision: Accept → Next Question OR Follow-up → Deeper probing
5. If follow-up needed, Host AI generates targeted follow-up:
   - Uses RAG knowledge of expert's evasion patterns
   - May research new angles in real-time if needed
   - Saves successful questioning strategies to RAG
6. Repeat until response meets depth benchmarks
7. Move to next scripted question
```

**Both Host and Expert RAG systems continuously updated throughout interview**

### **Step 4.2: Response Evaluation Criteria**
**Host AI assesses each expert response for:**
- **Depth**: Is this just surface-level or genuinely insightful?

- **Avoidance**: Is the expert evading the real question?
- **Recursion**: Has this pushed their thinking to new territory?
- **Completeness**: Does this fully address what was asked?

### **Step 4.3: Follow-up Generation Logic**
**When response is insufficient, Host AI generates:**
- **Clarification Probes**: "What do you mean by...?"
- **Challenge Probes**: "But doesn't that contradict...?"
- **Evidence Probes**: "What's your evidence for...?"
- **Personal Probes**: "How has your own thinking evolved on...?"
- **Recursive Probes**: "Are you certain about...?"

### **Step 4.4: Flow Management**
**Host AI manages conversation pacing:**
- **Time Allocation**: Ensure all topics get appropriate coverage
- **Energy Management**: Balance intense probing with reflection
