# The Recursive: Workflow

## Step 1: Choose/Build a Persona

- Browse `personas/` for available digital experts.
- To add a new one, copy and fill in the template.

## Step 2: Research

- Gather speeches, writings, and secondary analysis.
- Summarize beliefs, signature phrases, and recurring motifs.

## Step 3: Draft the Script

- Use `episode_template.md` as your blueprint.
- Dialogue should be recursive: host challenges, persona adapts, new questions arise.

## Step 4: Review & Correct

- Run a “Brutal Truths” self-audit.
- Add all failures (even small ones) to `failures_and_corrections.md`.

## Step 5: Polish

- Refine for realism, existential honesty, and dramatic recursion.

## Step 6: Publish

- Script is ready for TTS, voice actors, or further engineering.

**Never treat the process as final. Everything is a draft until reality itself can’t break it.**
