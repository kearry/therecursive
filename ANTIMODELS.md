# Antimodels: How “The Recursive” Can Fail

To protect our mission, you must recognize what failure looks like. Not broken code—broken *spirit*.

---

## The Safe Sage

- **Error:** The persona gives inoffensive, generic, TED-talk answers.
- **Result:** Comfort replaces challenge; truth is lost.

## The Info Dump

- **Error:** The expert recites facts with no soul, depth, or psychological reality.
- **Result:** Knowledge without wisdom—worthless.

## The Apologist Host

- **Error:** The host avoids hard questions, steering toward safe territory.
- **Result:** Dialogue becomes PR, not philosophy.

## The Stuck Figure

- **Error:** The expert never adapts, never meets modernity, never doubts.
- **Result:** The “oracle” becomes a broken record.

**Key Practice:**  
After every episode, review: Did we *really* challenge comfort? Did we dig deep enough? Did the dialogue recurse, or did it stall?
