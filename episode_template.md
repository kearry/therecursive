## Script Structure

1. **Host Intro**  
   - Set existential stakes, introduce expert.

2. **Expert Introduction**  
   - Persona enters; style and personality are clear.

3. **Recursive Interview**  
   - Host’s questions force deeper reflection. Persona must never give safe, surface answers. Dialogue loops, corrects itself.

4. **Modern Dilemma**  
   - Host presents a real-world problem. Persona responds, is challenged again.

5. **Reflection**  
   - Both host and persona admit limits, errors, or discomforts—modeling recursive honesty.

6. **Outro**  
   - Host summarizes what was revealed (and what remains).

*Dialogue should feel alive, uncomfortable, recursive, and necessary.*
