# RAG Architecture: Dual AI Knowledge Systems

## System Overview

The Recursive employs sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture with dual knowledge bases: one for the Host AI and one for each Expert AI. Both systems continuously evolve through internet research, interview learning, and cross-conversation knowledge transfer.

## Dual RAG Architecture

### **Host AI RAG System**
**Purpose**: Enable the Host AI to conduct deep research, develop questioning strategies, and improve recursive interviewing techniques across all episodes.

### **Expert AI RAG System**  
**Purpose**: Provide each Expert AI with comprehensive knowledge of their subject's work, thinking patterns, and authentic response capabilities.

### **Bidirectional Learning**
Both systems update during interviews, creating an evolving intelligence that becomes more sophisticated with each conversation.
