## 2025-05-24: Pilot Episode — MLK

- **Failure:** MLK gave a rote “I Have a Dream” answer to a question on AI bias.  
  **Correction:** Rewrote with an existential analogy about automation and moral urgency, drawing from his “Beyond Vietnam” speech.

- **Failure:** Host sidestepped MLK’s critique of present-day political apathy.  
  **Correction:** Added follow-up forcing host to admit personal complicity.
