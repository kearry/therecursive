# Culture, Philosophy & Recursive Self-Correction

## How We Work

- **Radical Honesty**: All feedback must be direct, specific, and unflinching.
- **Recursive Correction**: No value, persona, or practice is immune to challenge.
- **Disagreement is Required**: Friction is fuel for growth.
- **Anti-Bureaucracy**: Rituals (like “Brutal Truths” meetings) exist only to serve recursive honesty—not for tradition’s sake.

## Correction Rituals

1. **Episode Review**
   - After each episode, identify and record all shallow, evasive, or dishonest moments in `failures_and_corrections.md`.

2. **Quarterly Philosophy Audit**
   - Review this document and `VISION_MANIFESTO.md` every quarter. Update as needed. Record changes.

3. **Onboarding Challenge**
   - All contributors must critique and improve a past episode before contributing.

*The Recursive is not a set of answers. It is a question that never ends.*
