# The Recursive: Requirements Document

## Purpose

This document translates our vision, philosophy, and recursive process into specific, testable requirements. If any requirement leads to comfort over truth, stagnation over recursion, or shallowness over depth, it must be re-examined.

---

## Functional Requirements

1. **Podcast Episodes:**  
   - Each episode features a digital persona, rigorously researched and profiled.
   - Human or digital host must challenge the persona, pushing for recursive, uncomfortable truths.

2. **Recursive Editing:**  
   - All scripts must pass at least one recursive self-critique and revision cycle before publication.

3. **Onboarding Challenge:**  
   - New contributors must critique and rewrite a sample episode before making any contributions.

4. **Correction Log:**  
   - All mistakes, shallow answers, and failures must be logged in `failures_and_corrections.md` and reviewed regularly.

5. **Persona Profiles:**  
   - Every persona must have a `personas/<name>.md` file, with knowledge base, psychological style, recursion triggers, and failsafes.

6. **Episode Structure:**  
   - Scripts must include: existential stakes, recursive questioning, at least one moment of explicit discomfort or self-doubt, and a closing reflection.

## Anti-Requirements (What Is Never Allowed)

1. **No Info Dumps:**  
   - Episodes may not simply summarize knowledge; every insight must be interrogated and personalized.

2. **No Comforting Evasions:**  
   - Hosts and personas may never steer away from hard truths for the sake of likability or brand.

3. **No Stagnation:**  
   - If recursive self-correction halts, so does the project—until reviewed.

4. **No Shallow Hot Takes:**  
   - All “takes” must be recursively examined, not delivered as final.

5. **No Closed Processes:**  
   - All feedback, critiques, and corrections must remain transparent and open.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Transparency:**  
   - All project files and reviews must be accessible to contributors.

2. **Safety in Disagreement:**  
   - Disagreement is expected and protected; psychological safety is mandatory.

3. **Minimal Bureaucracy:**  
   - Only rituals that serve recursive honesty are allowed.

4. **Accessibility:**  
   - All docs and onboarding must be readable and actionable by non-experts.

## Stretch Goals

1. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
   - All AI/LLM systems must be auditable, their sources traceable, and corrections always possible.

2. **Live Critique:**  
   - Consider real-time “brutal truths” panels for episodes.

## Review & Revision

- This document must be reviewed at every quarterly philosophy audit. Any drift from existential honesty, recursion, or depth must be corrected and recorded.
