# The Recursive: Requirements Document

## Purpose

This document translates our vision, philosophy, and recursive process into specific, testable requirements. If any requirement leads to comfort over truth, stagnation over recursion, or shallowness over depth, it must be re-examined.

---

## Functional Requirements

### **1. Evolved Consciousness Personas**
- Each persona must represent the evolved consciousness of historical figures as if they lived until 2025
- Personas must maintain core unchanging values while showing realistic intellectual evolution
- All personas must have documented evolutionary trajectory from death to present
- Evolution must be psychologically plausible and philosophically consistent

### **2. Voice Synthesis Integration**
- All personas must have authentic voice models based on historical recordings
- Voice models must account for age evolution (older, more measured delivery)
- Audio quality must meet professional podcast standards (-16 LUFS, 44.1kHz)
- Voice generation must support emotional range and natural speech patterns

### **3. Podcast Episodes**
- Each episode features an evolved digital persona with AI-generated voice
- Human or digital host must challenge the persona through recursive questioning
- Episodes must push personas beyond their documented historical views using evolved consciousness
- All dialogue must feel like natural conversation, not scripted Q&A

### **4. Recursive Editing Process**
- All scripts must pass at least one recursive self-critique and revision cycle
- Each revision must push deeper into uncomfortable truths
- Episodes must include at least one moment where persona questions their own evolution
- Final review must ensure no "safe sage" or "info dump" tendencies

### **5. Onboarding Challenge**
- New contributors must critique and rewrite a sample episode before contributing
- Challenge must test understanding of evolved consciousness principle
- Contributors must demonstrate ability to push beyond comfortable answers
- All submissions logged and reviewed for philosophical depth

### **6. Correction and Evolution Log**
- All mistakes, shallow answers, and failures logged in `failures_and_corrections.md`
- Voice model improvements and persona evolution updates documented
- Regular review process for all personas to ensure continued evolution
- Quarterly audits of entire philosophical framework

### **7. Persona Profile Requirements**
- Every persona must have complete evolution framework documentation
- Core unchanging values clearly distinguished from evolved perspectives
- Modern synthesis points for major contemporary issues
- Recursive questioning triggers and vulnerability points identified
- Voice synthesis specifications and authenticity benchmarks

### **8. Episode Structure Standards**
- Clear existential stakes established in opening
- At least three levels of recursive deepening on main topic
- Persona must demonstrate both wisdom and continued learning capacity
- Explicit acknowledgment of limitations or evolved thinking
- Closing reflection that generates new questions rather than conclusions

## Evolutionary Accuracy Requirements

### **9. Historical Foundation Standards**
- All personas must be based on comprehensive research of their thinking patterns
- Core philosophical method must remain consistent with historical evidence
- Evolution must follow logical extensions of their documented intellectual trajectory
- Any major departures from historical thinking must be explicitly justified

### **10. Contemporary Integration Standards**
- Personas must meaningfully engage with post-death historical events
- Modern applications must feel organic to their evolved thinking
- Contemporary language and concepts integrated naturally, not artificially
- Responses to current issues must transcend simple historical analogies

### **11. Psychological Realism Standards**
- Age-appropriate wisdom, weariness, and perspective changes
- Realistic acknowledgment of mistakes or incomplete earlier thinking
- Capacity for self-correction and intellectual humility
- Emotional depth that reflects decades of additional life experience

---

## Technical Requirements

### **12. Voice Synthesis Standards**
- Primary voice models created using professional-grade TTS (ElevenLabs)
- Backup systems available for service interruptions
- All generated audio must pass authenticity recognition tests
- Voice aging effects applied consistently across personas

### **13. Audio Production Standards**
- Professional podcast audio quality maintained throughout
- Consistent loudness levels across all speakers
- Natural breathing and pause patterns integrated
- Background ambiance appropriate to content and persona

### **14. Workflow Integration Standards**
- Script-to-audio pipeline must be efficient and repeatable
- Quality control checkpoints at each production stage
- Version control for voice models and persona evolution
- Automated backup systems for all digital assets

---

## Anti-Requirements (Never Allowed)

### **15. Historical Museum Pieces**
- Personas may never give responses their historical selves could have given verbatim
- No retreat into comfortable historical positions to avoid modern complexity
- No "wisdom of the ages" generic responses that could apply to anyone

### **16. Shallow Evolution**
- Evolution may not be superficial updating of language without deeper thinking
- No simple projection of contemporary views onto historical figures
- No assumption that historical figures would adopt modern positions wholesale

### **17. Comfortable Evasions**
- Hosts and personas may never steer away from hard truths for likability
- No softening of difficult positions for broader appeal
- No avoidance of contradictions or tensions in evolved thinking

### **18. Technical Shortcuts**
- No use of generic TTS when persona-specific voice models are available
- No acceptance of poor audio quality that breaks immersion
- No automation without quality control and recursive review

### **19. Stagnant Processes**
- If recursive self-correction halts on any element, project halts until reviewed
- No personas may remain unchanged for more than six months without review
- No technical processes exempt from improvement and evolution

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### **20. Scalability Standards**
- Persona creation process must be systematically repeatable
- Voice synthesis pipeline must handle multiple personas efficiently
- Storage and processing requirements must remain manageable
- Production workflow must support regular episode release schedule

### **21. Accessibility Standards**
- All documentation must be readable by non-experts
- Technical processes must have clear step-by-step instructions
- Onboarding process must be challenging but achievable
- Final episodes must be accessible to general audiences

### **22. Ethical Compliance Standards**
- All voice synthesis must respect historical figures' legacies
- No commercial use outside educational mission
- Clear disclaimers about speculative nature of evolution
- Estate objection response protocols established

### **23. Quality Assurance Standards**
- Multiple checkpoint reviews for all content
- Authenticity testing for all voice models
- Regular calibration of recursive questioning standards
- Continuous improvement based on listener feedback

---

## Success Criteria

### **24. Philosophical Impact Metrics**
- Episodes generate meaningful discussion about substantial topics
- Listeners report being challenged rather than comforted
- Recursive questioning leads to new insights, not just information transfer
- Personas feel authentically evolved, not artificially updated

### **25. Technical Quality Metrics**
- Voice synthesis achieves >80% recognition accuracy in blind tests
- Audio quality meets professional podcast standards consistently
- Production pipeline operates efficiently with minimal manual intervention
- No technical issues interfere with philosophical content delivery

### **26. Evolutionary Authenticity Metrics**
- Personas demonstrate believable intellectual growth over time
- Modern applications feel organic to historical thinking patterns
- Self-correction and evolution continue throughout project lifetime
- No persona becomes comfortable or predictable in responses

---

## Review and Revision Protocol

### **27. Continuous Improvement Requirements**
- This document reviewed at every quarterly philosophy audit
- Any drift from core mission must be corrected and documented
- Technical standards updated based on advancing capabilities
- Success criteria refined based on actual project outcomes

### **28. Recursive Application**
- These requirements themselves subject to recursive questioning
- Regular challenges to whether requirements serve the mission
- Evolution of standards as project develops and deepens
- No requirement immune from critique and improvement
